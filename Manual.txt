A. Get antlr4 library
	1. open terminal and run the following commands
	2. cd /usr/local/lib
	3. curl -O http://www.antlr4.org/download/antlr-4.0-complete.jar


B. Copy the contents of LangTestGen folder to the folder you have put your *.g4 file.


C. Open terminal and go to the folder where your *.g4 file is.


D. Run htest.sh script. (WARNING: after execution this script overwrites any files 
                                  named "input.mol", "rules.par", "out.par" and any folder named "antlrOutput")

	./htest.sh [langName] [startRuleName] [testCount]
		1. langName is the name of your *.g4 file. langName of mol.g4 is mol
		2. startRuleName is the name of the starting rule of your grammar
		3. testCount is the number of times you want to generate code and test your grammar

	If result of the test is not correct, Error will be printed for that test, script
	will end immediately and all files will remain as they are for further investigation.
	(Note: running the script again will change previous test case)


E. Debugging
	you can debug your grammar using the commands antlr4 and grun.

	Note: for using antlr4 and grun the following commands must be executed in each new terminal opened:
		1. export CLASSPATH=".:/usr/local/lib/antlr-4.0-complete.jar:$CLASSPATH"
		2. alias antlr4='java -jar /usr/local/lib/antlr-4.0-complete.jar -o ./antlrOutput'
		3. alias grun='java org.antlr.v4.runtime.misc.TestRig'


	1. Run antlr4 mol.g4    (mol.g4 is your grammar file)

	2. Run javac ./antlrOutput/*.java

	3. Run grun [grammarName] [startingRule] -[option]
		grammarName is mol for our example
		startingRule is your grammar's starting rule
		option: a useful one is -gui. see antlr reference for other options
